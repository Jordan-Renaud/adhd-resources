    title: "What IS ADHD?",
    paragraphs: [
      'ADHD: "Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder" is a developmental disorder found in both children and adults. There has been some disagreement as to the exact cause of the disorder however it is largely thought to be a disorder of the executive functions that regulate parts of the brain. Another aspect of ADHD is dopamine and norepinephrine levels, both of which are neurotransmitters. The dopamine system is part of your brain\'s positive reinforcement system and reward-driven learning. Calling it ADHD is more of a description of the symptoms associated with the disorder than the actual disorder. We STRONGLY recommend that you watch this video it will help you better understand ADHD.',

      'You will likely find someone that does not believe ADHD is a real disorder and maybe even thinks it is just unruly children or people being lazy. This is partly a consequence of the name "Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder" which is nothing more than a description of the symptoms caused by the disorder rather than the disorder itself. It is very hard to help people understand what ADHD really is and what it is like to live with. You will not be able to change every person\'s mind, so try not to get angry or upset with people who do not understand what ADHD really is or have been misinformed their whole lives. Be patient and understanding since that is exactly what you are asking of them.',
      "Here is an 'NIH' and 'Am J Psychiatry' published article on public knowledge, understanding, and stance on ADHD and medication.",
      "Sometimes when a young adult is diagnosed with ADHD their parents/family do not understand or do not believe that ADHD is real. This can be extremely difficult and emotionally damaging. If such a situation is causing you a lot of emotional distress we ask that you see a therapist to help you cope. Also, understand that your parents love you and likely just don't understand. Speak with your doctor or psychiatrist about meeting with your parents to help them understand your disorder. Additionally, don't forget to post on the boards if you need to talk or rant, we are more than willing to listen and talk.",

    paragraphs: [
      "ADHD patients are at high risk to have comorbid disorders such as depression, bi-polar disorder, anxiety, panic disorders, etc. It is advised you get thoroughly tested for other neurological disorders before taking medication because some medications may agitate other disorders. It is important to diagnose and treat all comorbidities in order to maximize treatment. Since comorbid conditions are associated with greater cognitive, social, and psychological impairments, early vigorous intervention is warranted.",
